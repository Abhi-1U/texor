## Notes
There are no references to works/articles in my package that discuss the methods.  
This is because this package is built to convert legacy 'LaTeX` article to 
'Rmarkdown' based 'RJ-web-article' format.

Also there is a general requirement of pandoc >= v3.1. In case its lower than v3.1
the package will not execute the function, informing the user to upgrade pandoc.
